# petals-around-the-rose
A C++ Terminal game for "Petals Around the Rose".

Petals Around the Rose is a simple game. Well really, it's more like a challenge/brain teaser.

I first read about it here: http://www.borrett.id.au/computing/petals-j.htm, and struggled for 30 minutes trying to figure out the puzzle.
I eventually got it and thought "hey, that'd seem like a fun project to code!". So I made a command-line game for it.

Attached is the source code (.cpp) and the compiled .exe. Can you become a "Potentate of the Rose" by achieving a streak of 10 or more? Find out!
And of course, feel free to challenge your friends with it.

Code by me. ASCII art by Shanaka Dias.

Long term goals:
1) Colored terminal
2) Possibly a GUI for the game.
